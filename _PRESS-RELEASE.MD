Sometimes we want to get out of the house and go somewhere new. See the world,
visit famous sites, and try some fun things. But currently, you don't know where
to start, luckily we can help. Playcation is a family-friendly vacation planning website
with multiple fun features. We give our users a list of locations they can choose from
within a certain range, being in America. You will be able to see and create reviews
about the hotel you pick for your vacation. While also being able to see if there are any
problems in the area around the location you are planning to stay in, from crime to bad weather.
We even provide a community post to allow you to share how great your vacation was. But wait
you don't want to show others who you are based on the Google account you log in as. Well lucky
our site allows you to create a fake first and last name, we also have a bio so you can tell
more about yourself if you want.
